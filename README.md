# springmvc-springsecurity-login-and-register-page
 
## Introduction

This project is my Funix 3 assignment using spring MVC and Spring Boot to make a login and register pages

## version
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE) 
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included in this assignment. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
- Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in each project

## Project Detail:

-	This project did not use Spring Boot for me to feel the pain to manually config the project myself 
-	The config files are inside the “config” package
-	The project is configured using only Java (no XML) as this is the modern way . Yeah , I knew old projects still used XML config
-	This project follows MVC architecture.  I hope my naming of packages and classes are self-explanatory  
-	Hibernate validator is also used for quick validation

## Possible Issue
-	Minimal testing and only follow Funix requirement. And not yet trying to break the system by myself so there maybe bug outside of Funix Requirement

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
